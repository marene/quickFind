# quickFind
A simple async full-text search plugin for oni-vim editor

This plugin registers a command `marene.quickFind` that you can then bind to any mapping you like in your oni config file

# Installation
To install:
```
$> cd ~/.config/oni/plugins
$> git clone https://github.com/marene/quickFind
$> cd quickFind
$> npm install
$> npm run build
```
Then bind a key map to `marene.quickFind` in your oni config file, for example:
```
export const activate = (oni: Oni.Plugin.Api) => {
  oni.input.bind(["<c-f>"], 'marene.quickFind');
}
```

# How does it work?
Invoke `marene.quickFind` command: As you type a string to search in the quickFind menu, quickFind will search for it using `git grep` (or `grep -rn` if you are not in a git repo), and prompt in real time the search results
On selection of an item, it will open the file at the right line number, and populate quick list with all found occurences

# Note
This plugin is still under development.
However, it already is working good enough for me to use it at work, so please give it a try, and give me your feedback!
